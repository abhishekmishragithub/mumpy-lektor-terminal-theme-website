This is the placeholder website for MumPy, a clone of a [lektor-theme-terminal](https://github.com/terminal-labs/lektor-theme-terminal/tree/master/example-site) made by [terminallabs.com](https://terminallabs.com), which is meant to be evocative of an old Linux terminal; boxy and green on black.
Terminal is a simple Lektor theme made from [terminallabs.com](https://terminallabs.com), which is meant to be evocative of an old Linux terminal; boxy and green on black.
